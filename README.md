This project was made using ruby v2.6.6 and rails v6.1.6.1.

Using the Marvel developer API https://developer.marvel.com/, I created a simple app that allows
the user to scroll through all comics ever released from the most recent to the oldest and showing the covers.
The app allows the users to search by character (eg. deadpool) and allow the user to mark specific comics as favourites.

 Requirements:
  1. When I open the page I want to see a list of all Marvel’s released comic books covers
  ordered from most recent to the oldest
  2. When I see the list of comics I want to be able to search by character (eg. “deadpool”)
  so I can find my favorite comics
  3. When I see the list of comics I want to be able to upvote any of them so that the most
  popular are easy to find in the future
